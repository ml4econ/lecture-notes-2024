# Guidance vs. Guarantees: Fundamental Differences

- We've primarily relied on *guidance* for our work:
  - Selection of folds in CV
  - Size determination of the holdout set
  - Tuning parameter(s) adjustment
  - Loss function selection
  - Function class selection

- But in causal inference, *guarantees* become vital:
  - Selecting variables
  - Deriving confidence intervals and $p$-values

- To attain these guarantees, we generally need:

  - Assumptions regarding a "true" model
  - Asymptotic principles, such as $n\rightarrow\infty$, $k\rightarrow ?$



---
# Key Notations in Lasso Literature

Assume $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a $k\times 1$ vector with a typical element as $\beta_i$.

- $\ell_0$-norm is $||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_0=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{\beta_j\neq0\}}$, indicating the count of non-zero elements in $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

- $\ell_1$-norm is $||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_1=\sum_{j=1}^{k}|\beta_j|$.

- $\ell_2$-norm or Euclidean norm is $||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_2=\left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}|\beta_j|^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$.

- $\ell_\infty$-norm is $||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_\infty=\sup_j |\beta_j|$, signifying the maximum magnitude among $\boldsymbol{\beta}$'s entries.

- Support of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is $S\equiv\mathrm{supp}(\boldsymbol{\beta})= \{\beta_j\neq 0 , j=1,\dots,j\}$, the subset of non-zero coefficients.

- Size of the support $s=|S|$ is the count of non-zero elements in $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, namely $s=||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_0$




---

# Understanding the Basic Setup of Lasso

The linear regression model is given as:

$$Y_{i}=\alpha + X_{i}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad i=1,\dots,n,$$

$$\mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon_{i}{X}_i\right]=0,\quad \alpha\in\mathbb{R},\quad \boldsymbol{\beta}^0\in\mathbb{R}^k.$$

Under the **_exact sparsity_** assumption, we include only a subset of variables of size $s\ll k$ in the model, where $s \equiv\|\boldsymbol{\beta}\|_{0}$ represents the sparsity index.

$$\underbrace{\mathbf{X}_{S}=\left(X_{(1)}, \ldots, X_{\left(s\right)}\right)}_{\text{Sparse Variables}}, \quad \underbrace{\mathbf{X}_{S^c}=\left(X_{\left(s+1\right)}, \ldots, X_{\left(k\right)}\right)}_{\text{Non-Sparse Variables}}$$

Here, $S$ is the subset of active predictors, $\mathbf{X}_S \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times s}$ corresponds to the subset of covariates in the sparse set, and $\mathbf{X}_{S^C} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k-s}$ refers to the subset of "irrelevant" non-sparse variables.


---

# Lasso: The Optimization

The Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), introduced by Tibshirani (1996), poses the following optimization problem:

$$\underset{\beta_{0}, \beta}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i j} \beta_{j}\right)^{2}+\lambda \lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1$$

In this setup, Lasso places a "budget constraint" on the sum of *absolute* values of $\beta$'s.

Differing from ridge, the Lasso penalty is linear (shifting from 1 to 2 bears the same weight as moving from 101 to 102).

A major strength of Lasso lies in its ability to perform model selection - it zeroes out most of the $\beta$'s in the model, making the solution *sparse*.

Any penalty involving the $\ell_1$ norm will achieve this.


---

# Evaluating the Lasso

Suppose $\beta^0$ is the true vector of coefficients and $\widehat{\beta}$ represents the Lasso estimator. We can evaluate Lasso's effectiveness in several ways:

I. Prediction Quality

$$\text{Loss}_{\text{ pred }}\left(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} ; \boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}\right)=\frac{1}{N}\left\|(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}- \boldsymbol{\beta}^{0})\mathbf{X}^{}\right\|_{2}^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^k\left[(\hat{\beta}_j-\beta^0_j)\mathbf{X}_{(j)}\right]^2$$

II. Parameter Consistency

$$\text{Loss}_{\text{param}}\left(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} ; \boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}\right)=\left\|\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}\right\|_{2}^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^k(\hat{\beta}-\beta^0)^2$$

III. Support Recovery (Sparsistency)

For example, score `+1` if $\mathrm{sign}(\beta^0)=\mathrm{sign}(\beta_j)$ for all $j=1,\dots,k$, and `0` otherwise.



---
# Leveraging Lasso for Variable Selection

- Variable selection consistency is crucial for causal inference, considering omitted variable bias.

- Lasso frequently serves as a tool for variable selection.

- The successful selection of the "true" support by Lasso depends heavily on strong assumptions about:
    - Distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant variables.
    - Identifying $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.
  


---

# Critical Assumption #1: Distinguishable Sparse Betas

**_Lower Eigenvalue:_** The minimum eigenvalue, $\lambda_{\min }$, of the sub-matrix $\mathbf{X}_S$, should be bounded away from zero.

$$\lambda_{\min }\left(\mathbf{X}_{S}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}^{}_{S} / N\right) \geq C_{\min }>0$$

Linear dependence between the columns of $\mathbf{X}_s$ makes it impossible to identify the true $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, even if we *knew* which variables are included in $\mathbf{X}_S$.

**NOTE:** The high-dimensional lower eigenvalue condition replaces the low-dimensional rank condition (i.e., that $\mathbf{X}^\prime\mathbf{X}$ is invertible).


---
# Critical assumption #2: Distinguishable active predictors

_Irrepresentability condition_ (Zou ,2006; Zhao and Yu, 2006): There must exist some $\eta>0$ such that  

$$\max _{j \in S^{c}}\left\|\left(\mathbf{X}_{S}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}_{S}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}_{S}^{\prime} \mathbf{x}_{j}\right\|_{1} \leq 1-\eta$$


__INTUITION__: What's inside $\left\|\cdot\right\|_{1}$ is like regressing $\mathbf{x}_{j}$ on the variables in $\mathbf{X}_s$ .

- When $\eta=1$, the sparse and non-sparse variables are orthogonal to each other.

- When $\eta=0$, we can perfectly reconstruct (some elements of) $\mathbf{X}_S$ using $\mathbf{X}_{S^C}$.


Thus, the irrepresentability condition roughly states that we can distinguish the sparse variables from the non-sparse ones.

# Setting the Optimal Tuning Parameter

- Throughout this course, we have frequently chosen $\lambda$ empirically, often by cross-validation, based on its predictive performance.

- In causal analysis, however, the end goal is inference, not prediction. These two objectives often conflict (bias vs. variance).

- Ideally, the choice of $\lambda$ should provide assurances about the model's performance.

- Generally, for satisfying sparsistency, we set $\lambda$ such that it selects non-zero $\beta$'s with a high probability.

# "Naive" Implementation of the Lasso

Run `glmnet` 

```r
glmnet(Y ~ DX)

```
where `DX` is the feature matrix which includes both the treatment $D$ and the features vector $X$. The estimated coefficients are:

$$\left(\widehat{\alpha},\widehat{\tau}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}=\underset{\alpha, \tau \in \mathbb{R}, \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1}}{\arg \min } \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Y_{i}-\alpha-\tau D_{i}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\prime} X_{i}\right)^{2}+\lambda\left(|\tau|+\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left|\beta_{j}\right|\right)$$

**ISSUES:**

1. Both $\widehat\tau$ and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ experience shrinkage, thus biased towards zero.
2. Lasso might eliminate $D_i$, i.e., shrink $\widehat\tau$ to zero. The same can happen to relevant confounding factors.
3. The choice of $\lambda$ is a challenge.

---
# Moving Towards a Solution

To avoid eliminating $D_i$, we can adjust the Lasso regression:

$$\left(\widehat{\alpha}, \widehat{\tau}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}=\underset{\alpha,\tau \in \mathbb{R}, \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}}{\arg \min } \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Y_{i}-\alpha-\tau D_{i}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\prime} X_{i}\right)^{2}+\lambda\left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left|\beta_{j}\right|\right)$$

We can then _debias_ the results using the "Post-Lasso" method, i.e., use the Lasso for variable selection, then run OLS with the selected variables.

**ISSUES:** The Lasso might eliminate features that are correlated with $D_i$ because they are not good predictors of $Y_i$, leading to _omitted variable bias_.

# Solution: Double-selection Lasso (Belloni, et al., REStud 2013)

**Step 1:** Perform two Lasso regressions: $Y_i$ on ${X}_i$ and $D_i$ on ${X}_i$:

$$\begin{aligned} \widehat{\gamma} &=\underset{\boldsymbol{\gamma} \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}}{\arg \min } \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Y_{i}-\boldsymbol{\gamma}^{\prime} X_{i}\right)^{2}+\lambda_{\gamma}\left(\sum_{j=2}^{p}\left|\gamma_{j}\right|\right) \\ \widehat{\delta} &=\underset{\boldsymbol{\delta} \in \mathbb{R}^{q+1}}{\arg \min } \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(D_{i}-\boldsymbol{\delta}^{\prime} X_{i}\right)^{2}+\lambda_{\delta}\left(\sum_{j=2}^{q}\left|\delta_{j}\right|\right) \end{aligned}$$

**Step 2:** Refit the model using OLS, but only include the $\mathbf{X}$'s that were significant predictors of both $Y_i$ and $D_i$. 

**Step 3:** Proceed with the inference using standard confidence intervals.

> The tuning parameter $\lambda$ is set in a way that ensures non-sparse coefficients are correctly selected with high probability.

# Intuition: Partialling-out regression


Consider two methods for estimating the effect of $X_{1i}$ (a scalar) on $Y_i$, while adjusting for $X_{2i}$:

__Alternative 1:__ Run

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_{1i} + \gamma X_{2i} + \varepsilon_i$$

__Alternative 2:__ First, run $Y_i$ on $X_{2i}$ and $X_{1i}$ on $X_{2i}$ and keep the residuals, i.e., run

$$Y_i = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 X_{2i} + u^Y_i,\quad\text{and}\quad X_{1i} = \delta_0 + \delta_1 X_{2i} + u^{X_{1}}_i,$$
and keep $\widehat{u}^Y_i$ and $\widehat{u}^{X_{1}}_i$. Next, run

$$\widehat{u}^Y_i = \beta^*\widehat{u}^{X_{1}}_i + v_i.$$

According to the [Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWV) Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch%E2%80%93Waugh%E2%80%93Lovell_theorem), $\widehat\beta = \widehat{\beta}^*.$

# Guarantees of Double-selection Lasso (VERY Wonkish)

__Approximate Sparsity__ Consider the following regression model:

$$Y_{i}=f\left({W}_{i}\right)+\varepsilon_{i}={X}_{i}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}+r_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad 1,\dots,n$$
where $r_i$ is the approximation error. 

Under _approximate sparsity_, it is assumed that $f\left({W}_{i}\right)$ can be approximated sufficiently well (up to $r_i$) by ${X}_{i}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{\beta}^{0}$, while using only a small number of non-zero coefficients.   

__Restricted Sparse Eigenvalue Condition (RSEC)__ This condition puts bounds on the number of variables outside the support the Lasso can select. Relevant for the post-lasso stage. 


__Regularization Event__ The tuning parameter $\lambda$ is to a value that it selects to correct model with probability of at least $p$, where $p$ is set by the user. Further assumptions regarding the quantile function of the maximal value of the gradient of the objective function at $\boldsymbol{\beta}^0$, and the error term (homoskedasticity vs. heteroskedasticity). See Belloni et al. (2012) for further details.

# Additional Extensions of Double-selection

1. **Other Function Classes (Double-ML):** Chernozhukov et al. (AER 2017) proposed using other function classes, such as applying random forest for $Y \sim X$ and regularized logit for $D \sim X$.

2. **Instrumental Variables:** Techniques involving instrumental variables have been developed by Belloni et al. (Ecta 2012) and Chernozhukov et al. (AER 2015). For further understanding, please refer to the problem set.

3. **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects:** Heterogeneous treatment effects have been studied by Belloni et al. (Ecta 2017). We'll explore this topic more thoroughly next week.

4. **Panel Data:** Consideration for panel data was made by Belloni et al. (JBES 2016).

# Evidence on the Applicability of Double-Lasso

["Machine Labor"](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-11/Machine%20Labor.pdf) (Angrist and Frandsen, 2022 JLE):

- ML can be useful for regression-based causal inference using Lasso.

- Post-double-selection (PDS) Lasso offers data-driven sensitivity analysis.

- ML-based instrument selection can improve on 2SLS, but split-sample IV and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) perform better.

- ML might not be optimal for Instrumental Variables (IV) applications in labor economics. This is due to the creation of artificial exclusion restrictions potentially resulting in inaccurate findings.

# Illustration: Testing for Growth Convergence

The standard empirical model for growth convergence is represented by the equation:

$$Y_{i,T}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} Y_{i,0}+\sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_{j} X_{i j}+\varepsilon_{i},\quad i=1,\dots,n,$$

where 

- $Y_{i,T}$ national growth rates in GDP per capita for the periods 1965-1975 and 1975-1985.

- $Y_{i,0}$ is the log of the initial level of GDP at the beginning of the specified decade.

- $X_{ij}$ covariates which might influence growth.


The growth convergence hypothesis implies that $\alpha_1<0$.

---

# Growth Data

To test the **growth convergence hypothesis**, we will employ the Barro and Lee (1994) dataset.

```{r}
data("GrowthData")
```


The data features macroeconomic information for a substantial group of countries over various decades. Specifically,

- $n$ equals 90 countries
- $k$ equals 60 country features

While these numbers may not seem large, the quantity of covariates is substantial compared to the sample size. Hence, **variable selection** is crucial!

---
# Let's Have a Look

```{r}
GrowthData %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  head(2)
```


---
# Data Processing

Rename the response and "treatment" variables:

```{r}
df <- 
  GrowthData %>% 
  rename(YT = Outcome, Y0 = gdpsh465)
```

Transform the data to vectors and matrices (to be used in the `rlassoEffect()` function)

```{r}
YT <- df %>% select(YT) %>% pull()

Y0 <- df %>% select(Y0) %>% pull()

X <- df %>%
  select(-c("Y0", "YT")) %>%
  as.matrix()

Y0_X <- df %>%
  select(-YT) %>%
  as.matrix()

```{r}
bind_rows(ols_tbl, naive_Lasso_tbl, part_Lasso_tbl, double_Lasso_tbl) %>%

The use of double-selection and partialling-out methods lead to significantly **more precise estimates** and lend support to the **conditional convergence hypothesis**.
