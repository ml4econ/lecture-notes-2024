**Objective**: Convert words into numbers to make them computer-readable.

- Simple Method: Assign each word a unique number. 
- One-Hot Encoding (dummies): Use binary representation for words. Note: This is not efficient for large vocabularies.
- **Embeddings: Group similar words close together in vector space. This enhances language understanding.**

# Conditions for Double Descent (Dar et al., 2021)

Below are the factors that are both *necessary* and *sufficient* for Double Descent to occur:

1. **Low-Dimensional Signal Structure**
   - Intuition: Depicting a cat with simple shapes like circles and triangles.
2. **Alignment with High-Energy Directions**
   - Intuition: Amplifying the lead guitar sound in a band's mix.
3. **Low Effective Dimension in Data**
   - Intuition: Highlighting a few main characters in a movie with a large ensemble cast.
4. **Overparameterization with Low-Value Directions**
   - Intuition: Including a less focused background in a painting while the main subject remains the focus.

> Note: For further understanding, refer to the lecture by [Jean Czerlinski Ortega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBKq9MK3W0M).

???

The text talks about "good generalization of the minimum $\ell_2$-norm interpolator". This might sound complicated, but it's really about teaching a computer to make good guesses on new examples it hasn't seen before. Imagine you have a robot that's learned to recognize cats by looking at pictures. Good generalization means that if you show the robot a picture of a cat it's never seen before, it can still tell it's a cat. The "minimum $\ell_2$-norm interpolator" is a fancy term for a specific type of guessing strategy the robot might use.

"Low-dimensional signal structure" is like saying that the important information is really simple and doesn’t have a lot of different types of details. Imagine you're drawing a cat and you only need a few simple shapes - like circles for the body and triangles for the ears.

When it says "non-zero components of the signal aligned with the $s$ eigenvectors corresponding to the highest-value eigenvalues", it’s like saying the important details should stand out. Let's say you're listening to a band, and the lead guitar is the most important. You want the sound of the lead guitar to be louder and more noticeable than the other instruments.

"Low effective dimension in data" means that even though there might be a lot of details, only a few of them really matter. Like in a movie, there could be tons of characters, but only a few main characters are crucial to the story.

"Overparameterized number of low-value (but non-zero) directions" means having extra, less important details, but they shouldn’t be completely ignored. Like in a painting, the background is not as important as the main subject, but it's still necessary for the overall image.

# Next Word Prediction

- Upon processing the prompt, the LLM begins generating a response.

- The attention network assigns each token a probability, suggesting its likelihood as the next part of the sentence.

- The token with the highest probability isn't always selected. The LLM's creativity level, determined by its operators, impacts this choice.

# Some (Sobering) Facts abour LLMs

["Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00612) by Sam Bowman (2023):

.pull-left[
- LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation.

- Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment.

- LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world.

- There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs.
]
.pull-right[
- Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs.

- Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance.

- LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text.

- Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.

>`As an AI copy editor, your primary responsibility is to proofread a text enclosed by triple quotes and ensure it is clear and flows smoothly. Your task also includes avoiding passive voice, emphasizing essential concepts using boldface and italics, keeping sentences short and suitable for a presentation, and using bullets wherever possible. Additionally, you must verify that the title accurately conveys the text's message and, if necessary, change it to reflect the content. To deliver your output, you must present it in a Markdown code box. Once you have completed your proofreading task, request additional editing tasks if necessary.`

# Enhancing Functionality with ChatGPT Plugins

.pull-left[
- [ChatGPT plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) act as "agents" that augment the core capabilities of ChatGPT.

- OpenAI supplies "native" plugins with features such as web browsing and code interpretation.

- Over 100 third-party plugins are accessible and this figure keeps expanding.

- Research tasks: Utilize [Wolfram]() for mathematics, [AskYourPDF]() for lengthy documents, and [ScholarAI]() for literature reviews.
