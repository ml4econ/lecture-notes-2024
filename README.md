## Overview

This course encompasses a wide range of topics including data science, machine learning, and econometrics. Its primary objective is to acquaint students with the fundamental concepts of machine learning that can potentially enhance empirical economics. The course introduces popular supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, while emphasizing the challenges and opportunities of incorporating these methods in empirical economics. Additionally, it highlights the relevance of machine learning to policy analysis and causal inference. The course utilizes real-world applications, empirical articles, and hands-on assignments to illustrate various topics.

## Learning objectives

During the course, attendees will gain proficiency in the following:

1. Implementing data science best-practices in the context of empirical research within economics.

2. Acquiring comprehensive and pragmatic knowledge of the obstacles and prospects encountered in applied empirical work utilizing high-dimensional data.

3. Assimilating techniques and insights from the field of machine learning into applied empirical research conducted in economics.


## Prework

It is anticipated that participants in the course will:

1. Possess their own computers with R, RStudio (Posit), Git, and GitHub Desktop installed.

2. Register for a GitHub and Kaggle account, which are available at no cost.
